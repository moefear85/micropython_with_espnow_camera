## Receive Callback
You can block or do lengthy operations in the espnow receive callback for as long as you want, but if the wifi rx buffers fill up due to slow processing, packets will be dropped at the receiver after having been already acknowledged to the sender as having been successfully received. There is no easy fix for this, it would require rewriting the closed-source espnow subsystem in esp-idf so that the user-specified receive callback (ISR context) doesn't remove packets from the wifi rx buffers unless it returns with a specific status code, and allow the user to pop off packets later manually, and avoid acknowledging any further packets until there is space in the wifi rx buffers again.
